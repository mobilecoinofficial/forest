- fix a bug where commands wouldn't be sent after signal-cli was restarted

## 0.5.2

## 0.5.1

- payments code is moved into Bot and a new Mobster class that also handles the full-service http sesh, mob price, and financial tables
- invoice table maps unique amounts to users. registration payment monitoring code uncommented and mostly fixed, but rereads (with spam) the transaction log and re-credits

- restarts signal-cli when it exits to mitigate memory leaks
