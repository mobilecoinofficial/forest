            "source": "We believe in fast, secure, and easy to use payments on mobile devices. MobileCoin is currently available for use with one of the world’s most secure messaging apps. By design, it’s easy to link a MobileCoin wallet to your phone so you can start sending funds to friends and family, receive funds from them, keep track of your balance, and review your transaction history with a simple interface. Since the goal is to keep your data in your hands, MobileCoin’s design means no third party has access to your balance, full transaction history, or funds. You can also transfer your funds at any time if you want to switch to another app or service.",
            "agent": "Messaging apps aren't the only way to use MobileCoin. You can also use MobileCoin in your browser, or on your phone with a third-party wallet. But messaging apps are becoming a common way to send and share money with friends and family, or even do business."

            "source": "While other blockchains take as much energy to run an entire country, you could power all of transactions on the MobileCoin Protocol with the same energy needed to power a few households. Since MobileCoin technology uses the Federated Byzantine Agreement instead of Proof of Work, node servers are mostly idle – they only wake up to do work when there is work to do, saving enormously on energy consumption. And now, thanks to the MobileCoin community, MobileCoin is the first carbon negative cryptocurrency.",
            "agent": "MobileCoin is the first carbon-negative cryptocurrency. We use Federated Byzantine Agreement instead of Proof of Work to ensure that the network is secure and decentralized. And our community buys carbon offset credits to offset the cost of energy."
