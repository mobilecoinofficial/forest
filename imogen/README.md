## Advaced Techniques ##


Starting Image:
Imogen can generate your image based on a starting image. Attach an image and use one of the generative commands "/imagine /paint /priority /priority-paint" and Imogen will generate an image based on your prompt and the starting image.

Videos:
You can give imogen multiple prompts separated by "//" and Imogen will generate a video that transitions between the prompts. Will take longer than a regular /imagine.
Example:
/imagine Jane // Cake 

Distort:
You can combine the starting image and the video functionality to make images that dissolve into imoges. 
Attach an image and use one of the generative commands starting with Slash.
with image attached /imagine // Cake
